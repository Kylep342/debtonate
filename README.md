### Upcoming

Shared idea: "(focused) time travel view" - show cards 'at period X' in addtion to present value
 - visual table with selectable 'at period X'
 - essentially (maybe?) permanent HoverTemplate

 flag to always meet annual maximums across instruments (i.e. set minimum budget to 0 or instruments.reduce((instrument, accumulator) => instrument.annualLimit + accumulator, 0))


Want to have a comparison/summary page

e.g. for X (Instrument) show effects of each Y (Budget) side-by-side
