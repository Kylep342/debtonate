# AI Guidelines

## Vision
 - The product vision is an intuitive, data-dense financial calculator that helps people understand what they can have with smart money choices coupled to the unstoppable power of time and good habits.

## Code Philosophy
 - The codebase is full of patterns. USE THEM
 - Small operations that are general, shareable, and composable are preferred whenever possible
    - We should refactor often; as we uncover a pattern, extend it as far as is sensible
 - Assume in our back and forth changes I give you are intentional and incorporate them. If you think I make a mistake, ask a clarifying question before changing my changes

## Development
 - All code should be linted and covered by unit tests
 - Everything Javascript is Typescript
