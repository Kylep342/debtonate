      Debtonate is a financial calculator for analyzing debt.
      Specifically, it lives to answer the question: What if I could put an extra $50/month towards my debt? Or $100...?
      Debtonate empowers you to plan your finances with data-rich analysis.

      To get started, add some loans or other vehicles of debt.
      From there, add a budget, which represents additional payment per month over your minimum payment.
